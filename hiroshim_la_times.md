Rep. Mark Takano didn’t know about his family history in Hiroshima, Japan, until he visited relatives there in 2002.

He didn’t know his great-aunt was supposed to be working near the bomb site that day, or about the bodies that choked the river or how residents tried to use cucumber to try and cool burned skin that ended up falling off anyway.

His trip made the Aug. 6, 1945, bombing real to Takano, and the Riverside Democrat is asking President Obama to make a similar stop when he visits Japan next month, saying political leaders in any countries with nuclear arsenals should see the site themselves.

“I think it would be very meaningful for him to do before he leaves office,” Takano said in an interview between House votes Thursday. “It’s a place that I think people should visit. It makes you very thoughtful, very reflective, especially if you are in a position of leadership and power, this is a place you should go.”

No sitting U.S. president has visited the site where the United States dropped an atomic bomb in the final days of World War II. The blast and fallout killed 140,000 people.

Takano speculated that American politicians have likely wanted to avoid the appearance that the United States is apologizing. Many Americans believe that dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima, and on the Japanese city of Nagasaki three days later, were justified and hastened the war's end.

Seeing an American president visit Hiroshima would heal old wounds, Takano said.

“It would be enormously healing for both sides. We have an alliance that could be made stronger,” he said.

Obama is scheduled to travel to Mie, Japan, for the G-7 Summit on May 26 and 27 along with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

During his first year in office, Obama said he would be "honored" to visit Hiroshima, but a final decision about whether he will make the trip in late May hasn't been announced. The president has visited a concentration camp in Germany.

Secretary of State John Kerry visited Hiroshima on April 11 with others preparing for the summit.

Kerry called touring the museum "gut-wrenching" and urged all world leaders to visit.

"It tugs at all of your sensibilities as a human being. It reminds everybody of the extraordinary complexity of choices of war and what war does to people, to communities, countries, the world," Kerry said. "I don't see how anyone could forget the images, the evidence, the re-creations of what happened."

Takano spoke on the House floor Thursday and sent the president a letter urging a visit.

"A visit to Hiroshima is not an apology on America’s behalf. It is a signal that the commander in chief of the world’s largest arsenal of nuclear weapons appreciates their power and it sets an example for other world leaders to follow," he wrote in the letter.

A White House official would only say that the president is looking forward to the summit and further details about the trip haven't yet been released.
